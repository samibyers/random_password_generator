# random_password_generator

Description: This application is for a webpage that generates a random password when the user inputs their desired specifications. When the user clicks the generate password button, they are prompted with a pop-up window to specify how long they want their password to be. If the user does not input a number between 8-128 or they don't choose a number at all, then an alert pops up informing them that they must choose a number between 8-128.  The next choices are yes or no options if the user wants to include upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters. After the user specifies whether they want all these available choices, then a randomly generated password using only their desired choices pops into the text box on the page.
